# Changelogs
A public repo for posting changelog info.

For each component that we want to publish changelog information to we can use this public repo.

* Create a release log in you private repo
* If this is the first changelog from a system, create a directory for it
* Create a markdown file in that directory with name containing version and .md
* Copy the markdown content from the release log into that file
* Push the file into this repo
